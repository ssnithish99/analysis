The research article titled **"Predicting Student Dropout and Graduation: A Classification Analysis"** explores the use of classification algorithms to predict whether students will drop out or graduate based on a wide range of academic, demographic, and socio-economic factors. The study leverages data from a higher education institution, focusing on three primary classification methods: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

The **introduction** highlights the growing concern over student attrition and the need for educational institutions to understand key predictors of dropout rates to improve retention and academic success.

The **data description** provides details on the diverse set of variables analyzed, including marital status, chosen course, academic performance, financial status, and more. The dataset was prepared by converting categorical variables into factors for effective analysis.

In the **methodology**, Logistic Regression was used as a baseline, while Decision Trees and Random Forest were employed to capture more complex interactions among predictors. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to ensure accurate and reliable model evaluation.

The **results** showed that:
- **Logistic Regression** helped identify key factors, such as prior educational achievements and economic conditions, that impact student outcomes.
- **Decision Trees** provided a visual representation of key determinants that influence student success or dropout.
- **Random Forest** improved predictive accuracy by capturing complex relationships among variables, making it the most effective model.

However, the study faced **limitations**, such as class imbalance and the absence of critical variables like students' motivation and personal goals, which could affect predictions.

The **conclusion** emphasized the superior performance of the Random Forest model and the importance of using ensemble learning for accurate predictions. The insights from this study can help educational institutions develop targeted interventions to support at-risk students and improve retention rates.
